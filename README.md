## Introduction

This project aims to predict football match outcomes using advanced football metrics and machine learning models. By combining metrics like Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assisted Goals (xAG) with external factors such as weather conditions, referee bias, and team fatigue, we aim to achieve high prediction accuracy.


## Literature Review

### Football Metrics

Football metrics such as Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assisted Goals (xAG) provide deeper insights into team and player performance beyond traditional statistics.

### External Factors

External factors like weather conditions, referee bias, and team fatigue significantly influence match outcomes. Understanding these factors is crucial for making accurate predictions.

### Previous Work

Previous research in sports analytics has employed various machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes. This project aims to fill the gap by incorporating a comprehensive dataset and considering a wide range of influencing factors.

## Methodology

### Proposed System Diagram

Our system consists of several key components: data collection, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, and evaluation.

### Data Collection

Data was collected from multiple sources, including match statistics, weather data, and referee reports. This involved scraping data from APIs and compiling historical match records from online databases.

### Data Preparation

Data preparation involved cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. Feature engineering was applied to create new variables such as home/away fatigue levels and referee bias scores.

## Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the relationships between different variables. Scatter plots and bar plots were used to visualize the data, and a correlation matrix helped identify multicollinearity among features.

### Statistical Tests

Chi-Square tests were used to examine the impact of categorical variables like referee bias on match outcomes. ANOVA tests helped us understand the influence of weather conditions, while Z-tests compared mean xG values under different conditions.

## Model Implementation

### Machine Learning Algorithms

We implemented several machine learning algorithms to predict match outcomes:
- Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Stacking Classifier

### Model Training

The training process involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search and k-fold cross-validation to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy. The confusion matrix below shows the performance of the Random Forest model:

### Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis revealed that xG and xAG were the most significant predictors of match outcomes, with weather conditions and referee bias also having a notable impact.

## Discussion

### Findings

Advanced metrics like xG and xAG are crucial for predicting football match outcomes. External factors such as referee bias and weather conditions also play significant roles. The Random Forest Classifier was the most effective model.

### Implications

These findings have significant implications for football clubs, coaches, and analysts. By leveraging advanced metrics and considering external factors, they can make more informed decisions and improve match strategies.

## Conclusion and Future Work

### Conclusion

This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning in predicting football match outcomes. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model.

### Future Work

Future research could explore additional features, such as player-specific metrics and in-game events. Enhancing model interpretability and developing real-time prediction capabilities are also promising directions for further work.
