## Introduction

This project aims to predict football match outcomes using advanced football metrics and machine learning models. By combining metrics like Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assisted Goals (xAG) with external factors such as weather conditions, referee bias, and team fatigue, we aim to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Methodology

### Proposed System Diagram

Our system consists of several key components: data collection, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, and evaluation.

### Data Collection

Data was collected from multiple sources, including match statistics, weather data, and referee reports. This involved scraping data from APIs and compiling historical match records from online databases.

### Data Preparation

Data preparation involved cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. Feature engineering was applied to create new variables such as home/away fatigue levels and referee bias scores.

## Model Implementation

### Machine Learning Algorithms

We implemented several machine learning algorithms to predict match outcomes:
- Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Stacking Classifier

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 90.3%. The confusion matrix below shows the performance of the Random Forest model:

### Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis revealed that xG and xAG were the most significant predictors of match outcomes, with weather conditions and referee bias also having a notable impact.
